# Introduction #

OpenNERO consists of the core program and a collection of experiments.  Each experiment takes place in its appropriate environment.  The different environments in OpenNERO are called **mods**.  A mod is a logically separate unit of OpenNERO that can be a custom game or any other AI environment.  Each experiment is defined as a separate directory in OpenNERO's installation location. When you start OpenNERO, it shows a list of experiments that are installed and available for running.

# OpenNERO Platform #

  * Either:
    * [Download a prebuilt binary](DownloadingOpenNero.md)
    * [Build OpenNERO from the source code](BuildingOpenNero.md)

<a href='Hidden comment: 
Currently, the following experiments are included:
* [MazeMod Maze] - a simple maze world on an island, with search, learning and first-person agents.
* [BlocksWorldMod Tower of Hanoi] - a classic AI problem for planning.
* [RoombaMod Roomba] - a messy computer lab which gets cleaner with the help of some cleaning robots.
* [NeroMod NERO] - an implementation of [http://www.nerogame.org/ Neuro Evolving Robotic Operatives (NERO)], where you can evolve your own team of neural network-driven robots along a variety of fitness criteria.

= Controls =

The controls can be easily redefined, but in general, the following keys should work:

* *F1* - help (opens the browser to show this page)
* *A* - move camera left
* *D* - move camera right
* *W* - move camera forward
* *S* - move camera back
* *Q* - pan camera left
* *E* - pan camera right
* *R* - tilt camera up
* *F* - tilt camera down
* *space bar* - recenter camera to origin
* *ESC* - exit the currently running mod
* *Mouse Scroll* - zoom in or zoom out
* *Z* - zoom in
* *C* - zoom out
