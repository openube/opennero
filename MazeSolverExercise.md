## Introduction ##

In this exercise you will implement a method to solve a randomly generated maze. Read the wiki page on maze solvers: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm . We're trying to find a variety of solutions to the maze solving problem, so send us your solution and we may include it in the Maze mod.

## Instructions ##

Checkout the source for OpenNERO, and build as usual.

Go into Maze/mods/agents and add a new function following the pattern of the already supplied agents.  Then go into Maze/mods/client and add a button to activate your added maze solving method.

For testing you'll need to run it in OpenNERO, watch it and see if there's anyway you can improve it to work faster and more reliable.
